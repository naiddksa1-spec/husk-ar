 * Executable memory for guest code.

 * Every byte of arm64 code an Android app brings -- its libraries, and the small
 * stubs the loader writes -- has to live in memory the CPU will execute, and on
 * the phone there is exactly one source of that: the region StikDebug grants once,
 * at launch, as two views of the same pages. Code is written through the
 * writable view and run through the executable one.
 *
 * On a Mac there is no such restriction, but the loader is written against the
 * same two-view shape so the code that relocates, patches and addresses guest
 * images is the code that runs on the phone. The Mac gets its two views from
 * mach_vm_remap of ordinary memory.
 *
 * Allocation is a bump pointer: nothing is ever returned. The phone's region is
 * one-shot, so a freed hole could not be refilled by asking for another.
