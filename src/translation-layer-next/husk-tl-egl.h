 * EGL and OpenGL ES for guest code, over ANGLE.
 *
 * Android's EGL is a C API like any other and ANGLE implements it over Metal, so most calls
 * go straight through. What this layer adds:
 *
 *   - the display is made as an ANGLE/Metal display, whatever the guest asked for;
 *   - the guest's window is an ANativeWindow, which becomes a CAMetalLayer on the phone and,
 *     for tests on a Mac, an off-screen buffer whose contents are saved as images;
 *   - a few GLES functions take stack arguments that AAPCS64 (the guest) and Apple's ABI (ANGLE)
 *     lay out differently; those get adapters;
 *   - GLES names are resolved through eglGetProcAddress, which is how Android apps find them.
