/*
 * Husk -- iOS dual-mapped JIT memory for QEMU's TCG.
 *
 * Derived from AetherPS4-iOS's src/core/ios/ios_jit_allocator.cpp
 * (shadPS4 Emulator Project, GPL-2.0-or-later), ported from C++ to C and
 * reshaped to hand QEMU's tcg/region.c a split-W^X code buffer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * On iOS 27 every supported device enforces TXM, so an app cannot map RWX or
 * mprotect anything to PROT_EXEC. Executable memory can only be granted by an
 * attached debugger. StikDebug provides that service over a breakpoint-based
 * RPC (BreakpointJIT.framework):
 *
 *     BreakGetJITMapping(NULL, size)   ->  brk #0xf00d, x16 = 1
 *
 * StikDebug catches the trap, issues debugserver `_M<size>,rx` to allocate an
 * executable region inside us, then writes one byte through the debugger into
 * every 16 KiB page of it (`M<addr>,1:69`) -- which is what actually makes the
 * pages usable -- and finally stuffs the address back into x0 before resuming.
 *
 * We then make our own writable alias of the same physical pages with vm_remap.
 * QEMU emits code through the RW alias and executes through the RX alias;
 * tcg/region.c already understands exactly this shape via tcg_splitwx_diff.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one-shot rule
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * After setup the app calls BreakJITDetach() and StikDebug goes away. From then
 * on a BreakGetJITMapping trap is NOT serviced -- and an unserviced `brk` is a
 * fatal SIGTRAP, not a failed call. StikDebug can also be killed mid-session by
 * iOS's background wake-rate limiter.
 *
 * So: allocate ONCE, up front, at a size that is provably sufficient for the
 * whole session, and never plan on getting a second region. For QEMU this is a
 * natural fit -- TCG sizes its translation buffer once at init from
 * `-accel tcg,tb-size=N` and flushes rather than grows when it fills.
 *
 * husk_ios_jit_install_trap_handler() must be called early in app startup so
 * that a missed trap degrades into a NULL return instead of killing the process.
