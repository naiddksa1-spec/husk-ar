 * Everything under src/translation-layer/ is Husk's own code. None of it is
 * taken from Android Translation Layer (GPL-3.0) or from AOSP (Apache-2.0):
 * neither licence can be combined with QEMU's GPLv2 in one binary, and this
 * code is linked into the same app as QEMU. The doc's licensing section says
 * what that means for the parts of the runtime still to come.
 *
 * The entry points return JSON rather than structs. The only reader is Swift,
 * which decodes JSON in one line, whereas a struct would have to be kept in
 * step on both sides of the bridge by hand.
